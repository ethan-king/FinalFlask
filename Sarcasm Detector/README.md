# A Sarcasm checker for news headlines
A simple Flask API to detect sarcasm using Python and sklearn. 

The data powering this app is from https://www.kaggle.com/rmisra/news-headlines-dataset-for-sarcasm-detection.

Onion headlines make up the sarcastic headlines while Huffington Post headlines are not sarcastic. 
We train our Naive Bayes classifier on this dataset and deploy it using Flask.
